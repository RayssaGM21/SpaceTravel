## Learning About Exoplanets

Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system, and NASA has made incredible discoveries in this field. Since the first confirmed exoplanet in the 1990s, over 5,000 exoplanets have been identified, each exhibiting unique and fascinating characteristics. NASA uses methods like transit and radial velocity to discover these distant worlds and study them for signs of habitability.
